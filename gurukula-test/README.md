Currently a placeholder for Selenium tests for this application.

## Tests

TODO

## Test-tool requirements
These are some high-level notes on what I'd like to implement here

* [MUST] Run the tests against a real browser as well as headless
* [MUST] Define page-object library under src
* [LIKE] Selenium should be extended and abstracted from the page-object library
* [MUST] XUnit test functions should be a 1:1 mapping to the use-cases
* [MUST] Server must be configurable (default: localhost:8080)
* [LIKE] Generate a pretty-print html result output
